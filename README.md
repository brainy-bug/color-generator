## Technologies and tools used

  [https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js]()

```
The lightness or darkness of a color is called its value. Tints are light values that are made by mixing a color with white, which increases lightness. Shades are dark values that are made by mixing a color with black, which reduces lightness.

```

- ### React Icons
  `npm install react-icons`
